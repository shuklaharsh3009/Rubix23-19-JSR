    description1: "Plant Summer Crops-Before Summer crops can be planted, it is always important to prepare the soil. So test, test, test! If the quality of soil is low, farmers need to improve it by applying organic matter (manure) or ridding of soil salinity. Once the soil is ready, it is important to decide what crops they want to plant; corn, cucumbers, melons, and tomatoes are just a few to choose from.",

    description4: "TEND TO LIVESTOCK-It is wonderful that the farm livestock gets to spend more time outside, but that means more maintenance. Farmers must ensure that animals do not get overheated by implementing air circulation systems in barns and providing fresh, cool drinking water. Having a misting system, water pool, pond, or mud wallows also help keep livestock cool!",
    description5: "Summer is definitely another busy season for farmers. We cannot let the sunshine distract us from protecting what is important to us and remember to stay safe! Many farmers are known for their infamous farmers tan, but remember to wear sunscreen and drink plenty of water. Implementing proper safety measure when doing chores or working with equipment is also very important to stay safe on the farm.",

In India, droughts have become extremely common for a variety of reasons. It occurs every year in regions where water scarcity is already a huge issue. The severity of droughts varies from one area to region..",

The desert is advancing and this is a global problem. Opinions about the causes of land degradation and desertification, but especially about the solutions, are very divided. To discuss this, the biennial global conference on desertification will take place from 2 to 14 September. This is where policymakers, scientists, NGOs, female and male farmers and pastoralist, herders and companies from all over the world come together.",

The present crisis has been caused by deficient pre-monsoon rain in this season. In India, drought occurs mainly due to the deficient monsoon. It is a permanent disaster in India that affects 50 million Indians every year. 33 per cent of the country is chronically drought-affected while close to 68 per cent areas are drought-prone",

    description4: " Following are a few factors that play an important role in drought occurrence: choice of crops and agricultural practices,susceptibilities introduced by climate change,socio-economic vulnerabilities like hydrological and soil profiles,availability of soil moisture,availability of fodderCauses of drought in India  include  Region-wise Rainfall variations: South-West Monsoon is a major source of rainfall in India. It provides for about 73% of the total annual rainfall received in the country. But the duration of this season is very short.",

Try these tips for yourself to keep your garden or farm in tip-top shape.",

    description2: "Cover individual plants with pots or buckets. Simply flip the pot or bucket upside down and place it over individual plants.

If the top of the plant presses against the bucket, the stem could break.",

    description3: "Cut a drainage ditch at the end of each crop row. If your crop field doesn’t drain well, then water could pool underneath your crops and cause root rot. Try cutting a ditch at each end of a crop row to help that water drain. Dig a ditch up to 30 cm (12 in) deep so the water has a place to flow.If you practice no-till farming, then this isn’t a good technique to use. In this case, it’s better to protect the soil with mulch or cover crops.",

    description4: "Redirect water flows with dikes around your crops. Use either stones, soil, or sandbags and surround your crops with a dike, similar to a retaining wall, to block runoff from flooding your crops. This is especially useful if there are hills or elevated areas around your field.You could combine this trick with another one, like using the dike to direct water into a drainage ditch.If you build a dike with soil, plant some grass on it. The roots will help keep it in place and prevent erosion.",
    description5: "Remove saturated mulch and residue if it isn’t drying out. While mulch helps protect your soil, it could also support mold and bacteria if it’s soaked.

    description1: "Pesticides have proved to be a boon for the farmers all aroundthe world by increasing agricultural yield and by providing innumerable benefits to society indirectly but issue ofn hazards posed by pesticides on the environment and huma health has raised concerns about the safety of pesticides. The harmful effects and undesirable consequences can be minimised by alternative cropping methods or by using wellmaintained spraying equipment.Paracelsus also once said that the rig dose differentiates a poison from a remedy. Intense use of pesticides can be  reduced by promoting organic farming practices and searching for the bio-pesticides (or) biological agents to control agricultural pests in order to reduce the use of chemical pesticides. This is the time to act, in order to curb the utilization of pesticides to ensure the safety of our environment and ultimately health threats related with it.",

    description2: "The use of pesticides has resulted in various cases of acute and chronic poisoning resulting in varying hazard on human health from mild effects to death (Dawson et al., 2010)  Prolonged exposure to the sub-lethal quantities of pesticides result in chronic illness to human. The use of chlorinated pesticides and methyl bromide were associated with prostate cancer among farm workers over 50 years of age which is the second most common cancer in men after lung cancer. The farmers had a high prevalence of chronic dermo-respiratory symptoms such as cough, pharyngitis, bronchitis, asthma, dysuria, sinusitis, nasal irritation and contact dermitis.",

    description3: "D) Natural enemies The use of pesticides has resulted in various cases of acutem and chronic poisoning resulting in varying hazards on human health from mild effects to death. Prolonged exposure to the sub-lethal quantities of pesticides will result in chronic illness to humans. The use of chlorinated pesticides and methyl bromide were associated with prostate cancer among malefarm worker over 50 years of age which is the second most common cancer in men after lung cancer. The organisms that live by preying on other organisms are called as predators.The usage of pesticides in agriculture causes direct loss of insect pollinators and indirect loss of crops because of the lack of adequate populations of pollinators. Many scientists have demonstrated that neo-nicotinoids and other pesticide are a major factor in the decline of pollinator population and unusual instances of excessive bee mortality (Henry et al 2012).",
